ARAssistant is a university project developed by [aliinkaa](https://github.com/aliinkaa) and [akderebur](https://github.com/akderebur). It is a prototype of a productivity app in game format. It uses Unity's XR features for basic surface detection and placement. ManoMotion is used for hand tracking to interact with the virtual assistant. There is a UI for setting up a timer and choosing interaction objects.
